## Requirements

 - ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server)

## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

To be able to work with office files within Jira Cloud, you will need an instance of [ONLYOFFICE Docs](https://www.onlyoffice.com/office-suite.aspx). You can install the self-hosted version of the editors or opt for ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud which doesn't require downloading and installation.

### Self-hosted editors

You can install free Community version of ONLYOFFICE Docs or scalable Enterprise Edition.

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.

To install Enterprise Edition, follow the instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/enterprise).

Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

### ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud

## App installation 📥

1. Go to [marketplace.atlassian.com](http://marketplace.atlassian.com/).
2. Сhoose the ONLYOFFICE Connector for Jira and click the **Get it now** button.
3. In the pop-up window, select the site where you'd like to install your app and choose the edition you prefer, if multiple editions are available.

## App configuration ⚙️

Administrators can configure the ONLYOFFICE app via the Manage Apps section in Jira Cloud (Apps -> Manage apps -> Take me there -> ONLYOFFICE Connector for Jira -> Configure). On the configuration page, set up:

* **ONLYOFFICE Docs address**: The URL of the installed ONLYOFFICE Docs.

* **ONLYOFFICE Docs secret key**: Enables JWT to protect your documents from unauthorized access (further information can be found [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-configure-jwt.aspx)).

* **Authorization header**.

You can also connect to the public test server of ONLYOFFICE Docs for one month by checking the corresponding box.

## App usage

The Jira issue page includes an ONLYOFFICE Docs section, allowing users to create new files or edit previously uploaded ones seamlessly. If you don’t see this section, simply click the gear icon below the issue title and select ONLYOFFICE Docs to enable it.

### Creating files 📄

To create a new file, click the **Create with ONLYOFFICE** button. In the pop-up window, enter a file name and choose a file format. Currently, you can create files in the following formats: DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX.

Once you click Create, the file will be generated and instantly open in a pop-up window with editing permissions. The newly created file will also be added to the Attachments section for easy access.

### Editing existing files 📝

You can open any previously uploaded or created files in the ONLYOFFICE editors. Simply click the pencil icon to edit or the eye icon to view the file. The editor will launch accordingly.

### File access permissions 👥

* Downloading: Available to all users with access to the Jira issue.
* Viewing: Available to all users with access to the Jira issue.
* Editing: Users can edit files they have created. To edit files created by others, users must have the Delete All Attachments permission.

To grant the editing permission to a specific Jira role:

* Open the context menu for the desired project and select Project settings.
* Navigate to the Permissions section, click the Action button, and update the role list for Delete All Attachments.

### Important to know ℹ️

Due to certain constraints with the connector, the editor cannot remain open for extended periods. To ensure smooth functionality, it must be restarted every four hours.
