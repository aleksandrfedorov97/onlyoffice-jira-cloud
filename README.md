## Features

* Co-edit documents in real-time: use two co-editing modes (Fast and Strict), Track Changes, comments, and built-in chat.
* Create new files directly from Jira using ONLYOFFICE (new documents, tables, presentations).

Supported formats:
See [ONLYOFFICE Docs Atlassian Remote -> Supported Formats](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice-jira-cloud/remote?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-formats)
